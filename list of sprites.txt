List of sprites

1. hero sprite with animations walk, die, win (he's slowly stomping/tramping/galumphing towards the goal, right?)
2. enemy sprite with animations walk, attack, die
3. arrow sprite, doesn't need animations for now I guess
4. archer sprite with animations idle, shoot, perhaps won and lost.
5. midground: floor/land where the action will be, this could contain the path for the hero already
6. foreground: cliffs and whatever you want to have in the foreground
7. background: sky, clouds, mountains
8. goal (castle, perhaps princess) for the hero, though if you want you can draw this directly in the midground as the path is in stone as well too 
9. crosshairs for aiming
10. (unsure) UI elements like health bar
11. (unsure) explosion if we want exploding arrows later
